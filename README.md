This is an attempt at snake in godot, as part of a hackweek
'game a day' project. This was from the start of the project,
and that's obvious from looking at it. :)

Maybe it's good to include the planning notes and similar?
I've put them in. They show some of the thinking, though
I have notes dispersed between different devices and paper,
so they're not complete. Still, maybe interesting to see
how a project grows and diverges from its plan... even
the directory says 'planning', but is actually a mix of
planning notes and retrospective commentary, sometimes
within the same paragraph.

The code still has all the hacks, uncommented mysteries
and commented-out-old-code left in there. I might clean it
up, but maybe there's no point for this, and it's funnier to
leave it as-is.
