DAY 2 II

This wasn't a 'real' hackweek day, since it was the weekend, but I
was idly thinking about this snake, and how daft the implementation
was for various things. So I decided to just fix one doofy detail...
and another... and another...

I think the game-breaking bug is gone now. But maybe there are more,
just waiting to be discovered!

Since it seems like it works, now, though, I might actually try to
make it pretty, sometime. I did intend to put the score on the
screen, make nice music for it, make it possible to pause...

I'm still not clear on the 'right' way to scale sprites. They seem
to behave differently depending on whether you drag the corners of
the outline in the 2D screen, use the 'scale' tool, or set things
in the Inspector tab. Scaling the node itself seems to mess with
collision-detection, etc, presumably because it scales the
CollsionShape2D up to match. So you want to enter the .tscn and
change things there. But beyond that, I don't yet understand the
logic. Afaict, usually what I want to do is drag the corners of
the shape in the 2D pane. That seems to end up with the right
behaviour. But I should look into *why*, sometime.

(I did put the score on the screen, in the end. Was quick.)
